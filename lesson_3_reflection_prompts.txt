When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to work on the code from differnet computers or share your code with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You will usualy want to keep a static copy of the project as you work on it as changes introduced from the remote may affect your work.  

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks copy a project on Github and add the copy to your repositories. 
    Clone makes a copy of a Github repository or a local one on your system.
    Branch creates a copy of all commits within the repository.

    You would use a fork if you wanted to make a personal copy or a repositroy on github and plan to make changes that you don't want to push back to the origional repository.  A clone is used if you want to make a copy of the code and make changes that will be indepedent of the origional repository.  The branch is used with in the repository to test changes/code new features that will typicaly be reintergrated back into the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It gives you a changes to look through the changes before you merege your changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

	You could use dropbox to share files givin access to your collaborators would be eayser.  But managing the changes would be harder.  There would not be any check system for addiditon/modifications.  All code would have to be manual merged when someone "checks in"  or there would have to be a secondary file check out system that would have to be strictly managed.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If you are making changes for your specific need but don't really fit will well with the origional intent of the program.  Or if you want to develop the program for a different architector then it was designed for you would rather take changes from them to filter out arch specific changes.
