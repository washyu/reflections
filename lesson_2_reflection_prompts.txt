What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	One con is that git really only looks at line numbers for chagnes so you could have two of the same functions in different area of the code that could get automaticly merged together but you won't notice it till you complile run code.
	But this is probably a raretry and the auto matic merges will save you from having to check all the changes in the code per merge.
